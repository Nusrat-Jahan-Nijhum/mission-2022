                    <p>A personal mission statement defines who you are as a person (or as a team member where you work)
                        and identifies your purpose, whether thatâ€™s in the office or simply in life. It explains how you
                        aim to pursue that purpose, and why it matters so much to you.</p>

                    <h2>Vission</h2>
                    <p>I will trust my dreams and be the prisoner of nothing. I will use my private victories
                        unselfishly by trying to create value for others. The pursuit of excellence will determine the
                        options I decide to exercise and the paths I choose to travel. I will expect no more of others
                        than I expect of myself.</p>

            <p>We also limit ourselves when we fail to have a plan for personal growth. Thats not to say<br>that we
                must
                have every step mapped out for the rest of our lives, but just as a business requires<br>a plan that
                puts
                it in a position to take advantage of unexpected opportunities, so should we all<br>have a personal plan
                for growth that both keeps us moving forward and prepares us for the inevitable ups<br>and downs life
                brings.</p>
